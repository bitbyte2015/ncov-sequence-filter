Error in rule prediction:
    jobid: 3
    output: recombinants.csv
    shell:
        python predicter.py > recombinants.csv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job prediction since they might be corrupted:
recombinants.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
